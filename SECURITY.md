## 🔒 Security Policy

### Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

### 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

#### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

#### 2. Send a detailed report to our security team

**Email**: [Your security email here]  
**Subject**: `[SECURITY] Diabetes Pipeline Vulnerability Report`

#### 3. Include the following information:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, data exposure, authentication bypass)
- **Component affected** (e.g., Airflow, Spark, Docker container)
- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability
- **Potential impact** and severity assessment
- **Suggested mitigation** (if any)

#### 4. Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Severity assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: Next scheduled release

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

#### Code Security
- **No hardcoded secrets** in code or configuration files
- Use **environment variables** for sensitive data
- Implement **input validation** for all user inputs
- Follow **principle of least privilege** for service accounts
- Use **parameterized queries** to prevent injection attacks

#### Data Security
- **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest and in transit
- Implement **data anonymization** for non-production environments
- Use **secure data transfer** protocols (HTTPS, SFTP)
- Follow **data retention policies** and secure deletion

#### Infrastructure Security
- Keep **Docker images updated** with latest security patches
- Use **official base images** from trusted sources
- Implement **network segmentation** for services
- Enable **audit logging** for all components
- Use **secrets management** tools (not plain text files)

### For Deployments

#### Environment Security
```bash
# Example secure environment setup
# Generate secure passwords
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
export AIRFLOW_FERNET_KEY=$(python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())")

# Use secure file permissions
chmod 600 .env
chmod 700 secrets/
```

#### Network Security
- **Firewall rules**: Only expose necessary ports
- **TLS/SSL**: Enable for all web interfaces
- **VPN access**: For production environments
- **IP whitelisting**: Restrict access to known IPs

#### Container Security
```yaml
# Example secure Docker Compose configuration
services:
  airflow-webserver:
    # Don't run as root
    user: "50000:0"
    # Read-only root filesystem
    read_only: true
    # Drop capabilities
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    # No privileged access
    privileged: false
```

## 🔍 Security Scanning

We use automated security scanning tools:

### Code Scanning
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Safety**: Check Python dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis for security issues

### Container Scanning
- **Trivy**: Vulnerability scanner for containers
- **Docker Scout**: Security analysis for Docker images

### Dependency Scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Monitor for known vulnerabilities

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Development Environment**
   - Default passwords in `.env.example` (MUST be changed in production)
   - Some services run with elevated privileges for development ease
   - Self-signed certificates may be used

2. **Data Sensitivity**
   - Sample diabetes data may contain sensitive patterns
   - Ensure proper data governance in production
   - Implement data masking for development/testing

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Production Hardening**
   ```bash
   # Example production security hardening
   # Change all default passwords
   sed -i 's/admin/$(openssl rand -base64 12)/g' .env
   
   # Enable TLS for all services
   export ENABLE_TLS=true
   
   # Use production-grade secrets management
   export SECRETS_BACKEND=vault
   ```

2. **Data Protection**
   ```python
   # Example data anonymization
   def anonymize_patient_data(df):
       """Anonymize patient data for development use."""
       return df.select(
           hash_column("patient_id").alias("patient_id_hash"),
           col("age_group"),  # Use age groups instead of exact age
           col("glucose_level_category"),  # Categorize instead of exact values
           # ... other anonymized fields
       )
   ```
